# Library Server
## Project Description
This is a REST api that accompanies our library manager app (https://github.com/kristofer11/library-manager, catchy name coming soon). It provides endpoints for users (register, update, delete, login, etc) and their libraries (create a new library, add a book, delete a book, etc.)
